### Building forms with React Hook Form and Zod.

---

<br />

#### Forms are tricky. They are one of the most common things you'll build in a web application, but also one of the most complex.

#### Well-designed HTML forms are:

- Well-structured and semantically correct.
- Easy to use and navigate (keyboard).
- Accessible with ARIA attributes and proper labels.
- Well-styled and consistent with the rest of the application.

#### In this guide, we will take a look at building forms with [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) and [zod](https://zod.dev/). We're going to use a `<FormField>` component to compose accessible forms using Headless UI components.

### Features

---

#### The `<Form />` component is a wrapper around the `react-hook-form` library. It provides a few things:

- Composable components for building forms.
- A `<FormField />` component for building controlled form fields.
- Form validation using zod.
- Handles accessibility and error messages.
- Uses React.useId() for generating unique IDs.
- Applies the correct aria attributes to form fields based on states.
- Built to work with all Headless UI components.
- Bring your own schema library. We use zod but you can use anything you want.
- You have full control over the markup and styling.

### How to use?

---

```javascript
<Form>
  <FormField
    control={...}
    name="..."
    render={() => (
      <FormItem>
        <FormLabel />
        <FormControl>
          { /* Your form field */}
        </FormControl>
        <FormDescription />
        <FormMessage />
      </FormItem>
    )}
  />
</Form>
```

### Example

---

```javascript
import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod"
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form"
import { z } from "zod"

const formSchema = z.object({
  username: z.string().min(2, {
    message: "Username must be at least 2 characters.",
  }),
})

export function ProfileForm() {
  // 1. Define your form.
  const form = useForm<z.infer<typeof formSchema>>({
    resolver: zodResolver(formSchema),
    defaultValues: {
      username: "",
    },
  })

  // 2. Define a submit handler.
  function onSubmit(values: z.infer<typeof formSchema>) {
    // Do something with the form values.
    // âœ… This will be type-safe and validated.
    console.log(values)
  }

  return (
    <Form {...form}>
      <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className="space-y-8">
        <FormField
          control={form.control}
          name="username"
          render={({ field }) => (
            <FormItem>
              <FormLabel>Username</FormLabel>
              <FormControl>
                <Input placeholder="placeholder" {...field} />
              </FormControl>
              <FormDescription>
                This is your public display name.
              </FormDescription>
              <FormMessage />
            </FormItem>
          )}
        />
        <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
      </form>
    </Form>
  )
}
```
